***TIL - Today I Learned*** - is an acronym popular on some social news sites where users share spontaneous snippets of information they have come across, as opposed to fully researched, in-depth comments.

This site is my personal attempt to record such morcels of knowledge. They are largely intended as an aide-memoir and/or brain dump. Some are work focussed, some are completely random.

In many cases it is more a case of 'Today I thought it would be a good idea to write down', rather than genuine epiphany. If are you are a potential employer of some form of judgemental troll, please accept that I probably didn't just learn how to boil an egg, it's just I thought I'd record it here.

All entries at least start as a short sketch. Some may be developed here or elsewhere. Please use the information if you wish, entirely at your own risk, or feel free to send any comments.
